The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is to process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, in other words it is used by the software indsutry to answer the how, what, why, and when to implement enterprise software within a corporation.





Problem domain:

Meal delivery and meal preparation services are expensive and not practical; thereby, the market has not reached maturity and are not widely accepted. Furthermore, most Americans do not take care of their health and eat unhealthy alternatives such as: processed meals, fast food, microwaved meals, which lead to health problems long term. We are here to innovate a way for Americans to eat cheaper, healthier, and more conveniently. 






Solutions/Innovation:

1)	Make the price and practicality factor a viable solution for the customers at hand.

2)	Make recyclable containers then if a customer recycles their package, they will receive a discount. 

3)	500 yen in japan is considered cheap meal, thus anywhere between the range of 500 to 1000 yen is the price of a meal that an average consumer would pay in Japan. This is roughly $5-$10 USD. 

4)	Use Long-term supplier, distributor, and retailer relationship to drive the cost lower using batch ordering and economy of scale. 

5)	Use local farmers and local resources when available to produce unique products that are available in a specified area. 

6)	Help reduce diabetes, cardiovascular, and heart problems originating from unhealthy meals that most Americans consume.
